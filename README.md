# Data_Structure_Lib
These are header files for C++ to use Stack, Queue, Linked Lists , made in c++;


HOW TO USE;
1.  include the header file   #include "Stack.h"
2.  make Stack class object and pass size as parameter; 
    for ex. Stack obj1(10);   //size is 10
3. use push, peek, pop;
    for ex. obj1.push(10); //push the value 10, prints error Stack overflow if stack is full.
            obj1.pop();  //returns the top value;, prints stack underflow if stack is empty.
            obj1.peek();  //just return top value without taking it out of stack.
